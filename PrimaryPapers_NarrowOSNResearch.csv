THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES POPULARITY, REPUTATION, AND   SOCIAL INFLUENCE ON TWITTER USING LARGE-SCALE DIGITAL TRACES FROM 2009   TO 2016. WE PROCESS NETWORK INFORMATION ON MORE THAN 40 MILLION USERS,   CALCULATING NEW GLOBAL MEASURES OF REPUTATION THAT BUILD ON THE D-CORE   DECOMPOSITION AND THE BOW-TIE STRUCTURE OF THE TWITTER FOLLOWER NETWORK.   WE INTEGRATE OUR MEASUREMENTS OF POPULARITY, REPUTATION, AND SOCIAL   INFLUENCE TO EVALUATE WHAT KEEPS USERS ACTIVE, WHAT MAKES THEM MORE   POPULAR, AND WHAT DETERMINES THEIR INFLUENCE. WE FIND THAT THERE IS A   RANGE OF VALUES IN WHICH THE RISK OF A USER BECOMING INACTIVE GROWS WITH   POPULARITY AND REPUTATION. POPULARITY IN TWITTER RESEMBLES A   PROPORTIONAL GROWTH PROCESS THAT IS FASTER IN ITS STRONGLY CONNECTED   COMPONENT, AND THAT CAN BE ACCELERATED BY REPUTATION WHEN USERS ARE   ALREADY POPULAR. WE FIND THAT SOCIAL INFLUENCE ON TWITTER IS MAINLY   RELATED TO POPULARITY RATHER THAN REPUTATION, BUT THAT THIS GROWTH OF   INFLUENCE WITH POPULARITY IS SUBLINEAR. THE EXPLANATORY AND PREDICTIVE   POWER OF OUR METHOD SHOWS THAT GLOBAL NETWORK METRICS ARE BETTER   PREDICTORS OF INACTIVITY AND SOCIAL INFLUENCE, CALLING FOR ANALYSES THAT   GO BEYOND LOCAL METRICS LIKE THE NUMBER OF FOLLOWERS.","GARCIA, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, CHAIR SYST DESIGN, WEINBERGSTR 56-58, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;   GARCIA, DAVID, MAVRODIEV, PAVLIN, CASATI, DANIELE, SCHWEITZER, FRANK, SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, CHAIR SYST DESIGN, WEINBERGSTR 56-58, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.","ABISHEVA A., 2014, P 7 ACM INT C WEB SE, P593, DOI DOI 10.1145/2556195.2566588.

HOWEVER, USING SCOPUS DATA FOR DRAWING HISTORIOGRAMS   WITH HISTCITE (TM) HAS HITHERTO BEEN A PROBLEM. IN THE NEW VERSION OF   THE PROGRAM CREXPLORER, ONE CAN TRANSLATE CITATION DATA FROM SCOPUS TO   WOS FORMATS (OR VICE VERSA) AND THEN IMPORT THE DATA INTO HISTCITE (TM).   IN THIS BRIEF COMMUNICATION, WE DEMONSTRATE THESE OPTIONS USING THE   PAPERS OF EUGENE GARFIELD (1925-2017) IN SCOPUS FOR MAIN-PATH ANALYSIS.   THE TWO HISTORIOGRAMS ARE CONSIDERABLY DIFFERENT: UNLIKE THE WOS SET,   THE NETWORKED CONNECTIONS BETWEEN THE TIME LINES ARE SPARSE IN THE   REPRESENTATION OF THE SCOPUS DATA; THE SECONDARY DOCUMENTS (E.G.,   EDITORIALS IN CURRENT CONTENTS) NOT PROCESSED IN SCOPUS, BUT INCLUDED IN   WOS ENRICH THE REPRESENTATION. FURTHERMORE, HISTCITE (TM) HAS AN OPTION   TO EXPORT THE CITATION NETWORK AS A PAJEK FILE THAT CAN BE READ BY MOST   NETWORK ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION PROGRAMS. GARFIELD'S TEXTS ARE   CENTERED BY HIM AS A PERSONALITY AND ENTREPRENEUR IN DIFFERENT DOMAINS   MORE THAN INTELLECTUALLY, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF RECURRING   THEMES.

THIS PAPER   THEREBYENDEAVOURS TO TRACK THE EVOLUTION OF THE ANNOUNCED   HYPERCENTRALITY OF ENGLISH IN THE PORTUGUESE (LITERARY) SYSTEM IN THE   TWENTIETH CENTURY.

THIS EVIDENCE, THEREFORE, CALLS   FOR A RETHINKING OF THE OFT-MENTIONED CENTRALITY OF ENGLISH IN   CONTEMPORARY PORTUGAL AND FOR THE POSSIBLE CONSIDERATION OF A REGIONAL   SYSTEM.

THE RMF   CAMPAIGN TOOK PLACE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAPE TOWN AND COMPRISED   STUDENT-LED PROTESTS, WHICH CAMPAIGNED TO REMOVE THE STATUE OF BRITISH   COLONIALIST CECIL JOHN RHODES, AS ACTIVISTS ARGUED THAT IT PROMOTED   INSTITUTIONALIZED RACISM AND PROMOTED A CULTURE OF EXCLUSION   PARTICULARLY FOR BLACK STUDENTS. THROUGH A QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS   OF TWEETS AND A NETWORK ANALYSIS USING NODEXL, THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT   DESPITE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN SOUTH AFRICA, AND LIMITED ACCESS TO THE   INTERNET BY THE MAJORITY OF CITIZENS, TWITTER WAS CENTRAL TO YOUTH   PARTICIPATION DURING THE RMF CAMPAIGN, REFLECTING THE POLITICS AND   PRACTICES OF COUNTER-MEMORY BUT ALSO SETTING MAINSTREAM NEWS AGENDAS AND   SHAPING THE PUBLIC DEBATE. THE ARTICLE FURTHER ARGUES THAT THE \#RMF   CAMPAIGN CAN BE SEEN A COLLECTIVE PROJECT OF RESISTANCE TO NORMATIVE   MEMORY PRODUCTION. THE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATES HOW SOCIAL MEDIA   DISCUSSIONS SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS DETACHED FROM MORE TRADITIONAL MEDIA   PLATFORMS, PARTICULARLY, AS IN THIS CASE, THEY CAN SET MAINSTREAM NEWS   AGENDAS. MOREOVER, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT YOUTH ARE INCREASINGLY USING   SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES TO DEVELOP A NEW BIOGRAPHY OF CITIZENSHIP WHICH   IS CHARACTERIZED BY MORE INDIVIDUALIZED FORMS OF ACTIVISM. IN THE   PRESENT CASE, TWITTER AFFORDS YOUTH AN OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN   POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS, AS WELL AS DISCUSSIONS OF BROADER SOCIO-POLITICAL   ISSUES OF RELEVANCE IN CONTEMPORARY SOUTH AFRICAN SOCIETY, REFLECTING A   FORM OF SUBACTIVISM.","BOSCH, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CAPE TOWN, CTR FILM \& MEDIA STUDIES, CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA.;   BOSCH, TANJA, UNIV CAPE TOWN, CTR FILM \& MEDIA STUDIES, CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA.","ANG AU, 2014, INFORM COMMUN SOC, V17, P1228, DOI 10.1080/1369118X.2014.918635.

THIS HAS BEEN DONE TO STUDY THE CRASH OF AIRASIA'S FLIGHT QZ8501, IN   WHICH A THREE-STEP METHODOLOGICAL CASE STUDY APPROACH HAS BEEN EMPLOYED.   FIRST, A QUANTITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED IN ORDER TO   IDENTIFY AIRASIA'S (THE SENDER) CRISIS-RESPONSE STRATEGY. SECOND, A   SEMANTIC-NETWORK ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED TO ANALYSE THE RESPONSE FROM THE   PUBLIC (THE RECEIVER). THIRD, AN EXTENSION OF THIS SEMANTIC-NETWORK   ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYSE TO WHICH EXTENT THE FRAMING OF AIRASIA'S   ONLINE CRISIS COMMUNICATION HAD BEEN ALIGNED WITH THE PUBLIC FRAMING OF   THE CRASH. THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST STEP INDICATED THAT AIRASIA   PREDOMINATELY USED AN INFORMATIONAL STRATEGY (E.G., ADJUSTING   INFORMATION). MOREOVER, THE FINDINGS OF THE SECOND AND THIRD STEPS   REVEALED THAT THERE WAS AN ABSENCE OF FRAME ALIGNMENT BETWEEN AIRASIA'S   RESPONSE STRATEGY AND THE PUBLIC'S RESPONSE. COMPARED TO THE   ORGANISATION, THE PUBLIC'S REACTIONS REVEALED MORE EMOTIONAL ASPECTS IN   THEIR FRAMING. (C) 2016 ELSEVIER INC.

FROM THESE STATISTICS AND STORIES, WE ALREADY KNOW THAT   INDEPENDENT TECHNICAL COMMUNICATORS FACE CHALLENGES RANGING FROM LEGAL   ISSUES TO ESTABLISHING MARKETING VISIBILITY WHEN THEY START AND MAINTAIN   BUSINESSES. DRAWING ON THICK QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTION FROM SEMISTRUCTURED   INTERVIEWS, THIS ARTICLE RESPONDS TO THE NEED FOR MORE SYSTEMATIC   RESEARCH TRACING THE NETWORKING PRACTICES, TECHNOLOGIES, AND   RELATIONSHIPS THAT ENABLE ENTREPRENEURIAL WORK. RESEARCH QUESTION: HOW   DO ESTABLISHED INDIVIDUAL ENTREPRENEURS IN TC DESCRIBE THE SOCIAL   RELATIONSHIPS, NETWORKING PRACTICES, AND NETWORKING TECHNOLOGIES THAT   SHAPE THEIR CAREERS OVER TIME? LITERATURE REVIEW: THIS PROJECT EXTENDS   PRIOR RESEARCH AT THE INTERSECTIONS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, TECHNICAL   COMMUNICATION, AND SOCIAL NETWORKS. ENTREPRENEURIAL STUDIES RESEARCH   INDICATES THAT STRONG SOCIAL TIES AND EMBEDDEDNESS INFLUENCE VENTURE   PERFORMANCE; HOWEVER, SYSTEMATIC SCHOLARSHIP ON THE NETWORKS OR   NETWORKING PRACTICES OF INDEPENDENT OR ENTREPRENEURIAL TECHNICAL   COMMUNICATION PRACTICE HAS BEEN LIMITED. METHODOLOGY: THE PROJECT USED   SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS TO ANALYZE THE PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION   PRACTICES OF EIGHT TECHNICAL COMMUNICATORS WITH CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE   WORKING INDEPENDENTLY AS CONSULTANTS OR SMALL-BUSINESS OWNERS. WE USED   AN ONLINE SEARCH TO IDENTIFY EXPERIENCED ENTREPRENEURS IN THE   INTERDISCIPLINARY FIELD OF TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION. AFTER RECRUITING   PARTICIPANTS VIA EMAIL, WE CONDUCTED SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS TO GATHER   EMPLOYMENT NARRATIVES, WHILE PROMPTING PARTICIPANTS TO SHARE INFORMATION   ABOUT CAREER-RELEVANT TIES, NETWORKING PRACTICES, AND NETWORKING   TECHNOLOGIES. WE THEN ANALYZED DATA THROUGH TWO ITERATIVE QUALITATIVE   CODING PASSES. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: OUR PARTICIPANTS, MADE UP OF   EXPERIENCED TC ENTREPRENEURS, HAVE USED NETWORKING OVER AT LEAST TWO   DECADES TO ADVANCE PERSONAL BUSINESS OUTCOMES AND EVOLVE TECHNICAL   COMMUNICATION AS A FIELD AND PROFESSION. FINDINGS DETAIL HOW NETWORKING   IS CENTRAL TO PROFESSIONAL SOCIAL KNOWLEDGE CONSTRUCTION, AS TC   ENTREPRENEURS ESTABLISH TRANSACTIONAL CONTACT WITH OTHERS, PRACTICE   LEARNING, AND ENACT EXPONENTIAL REPUTATION-BUILDING THAT ADDRESSES THE   ISOLATION OF WORKING OUTSIDE TRADITIONAL ORGANIZATIONS. SINCE THIS IS A   QUALITATIVE STUDY BASED ON SELF-REPORT, THE RESULTS ARE NOT   GENERALIZABLE BUT PROVIDE A FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE LARGER-SCALE RESEARCH   BUILDING FROM THESE QUALITATIVE THEMES.","LAUREN, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT WRITING RHETOR \& AMER CULTURES, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;   LAUREN, BENJAMIN, MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT WRITING RHETOR \& AMER CULTURES, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;   PIGG, STACEY, NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIV, DEPT ENGLISH, RALEIGH, NC 27695 USA.","AMIDON S, 2008, J BUS TECH COMMUN, V22, P5, DOI 10.1177/1050651907307698.

METHOD: THE ARTICLE USES QUALITATIVE METHODS INFORMED BY THEORIES OF   SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE INTERVIEW DATA COLLECTED FROM EIGHT   SUCCESSFUL TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION ENTREPRENEURS.   RESULTS: TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION ENTREPRENEURS ACTIVELY PUBLISH AND READ   PUBLICATIONS TO LEARN RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE FIELD, INFLUENCE   PRACTICE, AND BUILD PROFESSIONAL CONVERSATIONS.

THE LITERATURE, HOWEVER, TOO   OFTEN IGNORES ONE FACTOR IN DISCUSSIONS OF ICTS' IMPORTANCE AND   EMPLOYMENT: ELECTRICITY. OVERLOOKING THE CENTRALITY OF ELECTRICITY TO   ANY ICT FOR DEVELOPMENT (ICT4D) INITIATIVE HAS ENORMOUS CONSEQUENCES;   COUNTLESS INITIATIVES HAVE FAILED TO CONSIDER THE (IN)ABILITY TO POWER   THE TECHNOLOGY THAT IS CENTRAL TO SUCH DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. THE PRESENT   ARTICLE SEEKS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP BY EMPHASIZING THE PRIMACY OF   ELECTRICITY IN ICT4D INITIATIVES. UTILIZING A UNIQUE DATASET THAT AVOIDS   ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH UNRELIABLY MEASURED AND INEQUITABLY DISTRIBUTED   GRID POWER, WE EXAMINE THE DRIVERS OF INTERNET ADOPTION IN LOW-INCOME   COUNTRIES. WE FIND ROBUST EVIDENCE THAT INCREASING THE DISTRIBUTION OF   ELECTRICITY WITHIN UNDER-SERVED COUNTRIES AND THEREBY MAKING ELECTRICITY   AVAILABLE TO A LARGER PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION SIGNIFICANTLY   INCREASES THE NUMBER OF INTERNET USERS. ARGUABLY, IMPROVEMENTS IN   INFRASTRUCTURE MAY BRING ABOUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INTERNET USE, EVEN   IN PLACES WHERE ADVANCEMENTS IN EDUCATION AND POLITICAL REPRESENTATION   REMAIN ELUSIVE.

LOOKING AT THE DETERMINANTS OF MOBILE NETWORK COVERAGE   HELPS HIGHLIGHT BOTH OPERATORS' STRATEGIES AND INDIVIDUAL USERS'   DECISIONS.

THE LOCATION AND DENSITY   OF THESE ANTENNAS PROVIDES INFORMATION FOR AREAS WITH SIGNIFICANT DEMAND   BUT POOR COVERAGE-AREAS WHERE COVERAGE IS EFFECTIVELY CROWDSOURCED. IN   CONTRAST TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FIXED-LINE NETWORKS, AVERAGE INCOME,   POPULATION, GEOGRAPHY, AND EDUCATION ARE THE MAIN DRIVERS OF BOTH   TELECOM AND FEMTO-CELL BASED MOBILE COVERAGE.

THE MAIN INTEREST IS IN TESTING WHETHER LOOSELY STRUCTURED   COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE, WITHOUT DEFINED ROLES AND LEADERS, LEADS TO LESS   CENTRALIZED ENGAGEMENT. WE USE NETWORK ANALYSIS TO UNCOVER AND COMPARE   THREE ENDOGENOUS NETWORK ATTRIBUTES IN TWO ONLINE MUSIC PRODUCTION   COMMUNITIES, WHERE PARTICIPANTS PRODUCE PUBLIC GOODS MAINLY THROUGH TWO   STRATEGIES: AD-HOC COLLABORATION AND TEAM-BASED COLLABORATION. THE   ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF FORMAL STRUCTURE IN   COLLABORATION DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAD TO GREATER CENTRALIZATION. IN   FACT, MORE LOOSELY STRUCTURED COLLABORATION CAN RESULT IN HIGHER   CENTRALIZATION, WHEREBY A SMALL NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS EMERGE AS FOCAL   POINTS FOR THE PRODUCTIVE OUTPUT OF THE COMMUNITY.","WANG, R (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV SOUTHERN CALIF, LOS ANGELES, CA 90007 USA.;   WANG, RONG, UNIV SOUTHERN CALIF, LOS ANGELES, CA 90007 USA.;   CHELIOTIS, GIORGOS, NATL UNIV SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE.","ATOUBA Y, 2010, J COMMUN, V60, P293, DOI 10.1111/J.1460-2466.2010.01483.X.

DECISIONS ABOUT WHICH MATERIAL   AND WHICH USERS TO INCLUDE ON THE SCREEN COMPRISE A NEW ARENA FOR THE   GATEKEEPING FUNCTION OF THE ESTABLISHED MEDIA. IN THIS PAPER, I   INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF SECOND-SCREEN GATEKEEPING AS A THEORETICAL   FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING THE GATEKEEPING PRACTICE TAKING PLACE   BETWEEN THE FIRST AND THE SECOND SCREENS. TO EXAMINE THIS EMERGENT   PRACTICE OF SECOND-SCREEN GATEKEEPING, THE PAPER INTRODUCES AN EMPIRICAL   STUDY OF THE SELECTION PROCESS OF MATERIAL FROM SOCIAL NETWORK SITES IN   THE LIVE-BROADCAST ELECTION DEBATES ON DENMARK'S TWO LEADING TELEVISION   CHANNELS, THE PUBLIC SERVICE INSTITUTION DR1 AND THE COMMERCIAL STATION   TV2, IN THE RUN-UP TO THE EUROPEAN ELECTIONS IN DENMARK IN 2014, DRAWING   ON BOTH QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH THE INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE FOR   SELECTING MATERIAL AS WELL AS A QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES OF THE   DISTRIBUTION OF CONTENT IN THE DEBATES. A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF UPDATES   FROM SOCIAL NETWORK SITES REFERENCED IN THE TWO DEBATES IS PRESENTED   THAT SUGGESTS DIFFERENCES IN THE SELECTION PRACTICES OF THE TWO   INSTITUTIONS IN RELATION TO THE THEMATIC CONTENT OF THE UPDATES AS WELL   AS IN TERMS OF WHICH TYPES OF USERS THAT WERE REFERENCED ON THE SCREEN.

THERE IS A GROWING EMPHASIS ON   EXPANDING THE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY IN INTERGENERATIONAL PROGRAMMES, WITHIN   THE FIELD OF INTERGENERATIONAL STUDIES. CONSEQUENTLY, THIS PAPER IS   FOCUSED ON EDUCATION AND LEARNING PROCESSES WITHIN INTERGENERATIONAL   PROGRAMMES WITH A STRONG TECHNOLOGY COMPONENT. INFORMATION FROM A TOTAL   OF 46 INTERGENERATIONAL PROGRAMMES FROM 11 COUNTRIES HAS BEEN GATHERED   THROUGH A SURVEY. LEVEL OF IMPACT, STATUS OF GENERATIONAL GROUPS, AND   CENTRALITY OF TECHNOLOGY HAVE BEEN APPRAISED FOR ALL PROGRAMMES IN THE   SAMPLE. TECHNOLOGY LEARNING-TEACHING CONSTITUTE THE MAIN AREA OF   INTENDED IMPACT OF THESE PROGRAMMES. HOWEVER, THE SURVEYED PROGRAMMES   EMPLOY AS WELL A WIDE RANGE OF STRATEGIES TO FACILITATE   INTERGENERATIONAL COMMUNICATION, COOPERATION AND RELATIONSHIP FORMATION   BETWEEN GENERATIONS INVOLVED. INTEREST OF PROGRAMMES EXAMINED DOES NOT   JUST CONSIST OF TEACHING THE USE TECHNOLOGY BUT OF EXPERIMENTING WITH   TECHNOLOGY IN DIFFERENT FORMS AND FUNCTIONS AND EXPLORING THE POSITIVE   POTENTIAL FOR ENHANCING INTERGENERATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS.","SANCHEZ, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GRANADA, DEPT SOCIOL, E-18071 GRANADA, SPAIN.;   SANCHEZ, MARIANO, UNIV GRANADA, DEPT SOCIOL, E-18071 GRANADA, SPAIN.;   KAPLAN, MATTHEW S., PENN STATE UNIV, DEPT AGR ECON SOCIOL \& EDUC, STATE COLL, PA USA.;   BRADLEY, LEAH, JEWISH COUNCIL AGING, HEYMAN INTERAGES CTR, ROCKVILLE, MD USA.","AARP, 2012, CONN GEN.

IT   DEVELOPS A CONTEXTUAL ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK CONTENDING THAT THE STRUCTURE   OF THE HYPERLINK NETWORK IS INFLUENCED BY UTILITY VALUES AND UTILIZATION   CAPABILITY, AS WELL AS THE MEDIA AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTS THAT SHAPE   THESE VALUES, RESPECTIVELY. THE RESULTS OF THE EXPONENTIAL RANDOM GRAPH   MODELS SUPPORT THIS FRAMEWORK. SPECIFICALLY, HYPERLINKS ARE MORE LIKELY   TO BE CREATED AMONG NEIGHBORHOOD HOMEOWNER FORUMS WHEN THE NEIGHBORHOODS   ARE LOCATED IN THE SAME ADMINISTRATIVE DISTRICT, BUILT BY THE SAME   DEVELOPERS, AND MANAGED BY THE SAME PROPERTY MANAGEMENT COMPANIES.   UNFAVORABLE CONTEXTS THAT ARE PRONE TO VIOLENT CONFRONTATION HAMPER THE   CREATION OF CROSS-FORUM HYPERLINKS, BUT MEDIA VISIBILITY INCREASES THE   ODDS OF OTHER FORUMS HYPERLINKING TO HOMEOWNER FORUMS. IN ADDITION, HIGH   LEVELS OF ONLINE ENGAGEMENT ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH HYPERLINK   FORMATION. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ALTHOUGH ONLINE PLATFORMS, SUCH   AS HOMEOWNER FORUMS, PLAY A CONTRIBUTORY ROLE IN COLLECTIVE ACTION, THEY   HAVE LIMITED POWER IN FOSTERING CROSS-NEIGHBORHOOD COALITIONS IN URBAN   CHINA.","HUANG, RG (REPRINT AUTHOR), FUDAN UNIV, DEPT SOCIOL, SHANGHAI, PEOPLES R CHINA.;   HUANG, RONGGUI, FUDAN UNIV, DEPT SOCIOL, SHANGHAI, PEOPLES R CHINA.;   SUN, XIAOYI, CITY UNIV HONG KONG, DEPT PUBL POLICY, HONG KONG, HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.","ACKLAND R, 2011, SOC NETWORKS, V33, P177, DOI 10.1016/J.SOCNET.2011.03.001.

THE   CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK BUILDS UPON BOURDIEU'S FIELD THEORY, APPROPRIATED   ON SOCIAL MEDIA AS MEDIATED SOCIAL SPACES. THE STUDY INVESTIGATES   CONVERSATION PATTERNS ON TWITTER BETWEEN POLITICAL, MEDIA AND CITIZEN   AGENTS DURING ELECTION TIMES IN BELGIUM. THROUGH THE COMPARISON OF   CONVERSATIONAL PRACTICES WITH THE POSITIONS USERS HOLD AS POLITICAL,   MEDIA OR CITIZEN AGENTS, WE UNDERSTAND HOW THE FORMER IS RELATED TO THE   LATTER. THE ANALYSIS OF CONVERSATION PATTERNS (BASED ON REPLIES AND   MENTIONS) SHOWS A DECENTRALIZED AND LOOSELY KNIT NETWORK, IN WHICH   PRIMARILY CITIZEN AGENTS ARE PRESENT. NONETHELESS, THE PROMINENCE OF   CITIZENS IN THE DEBATE, MENTIONS OR REPLIES TO POLITICAL AND MEDIA   AGENTS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, PLACING THEM MORE CENTRALLY IN THE   NETWORK. IN ADDITION, POLITICIANS AND MEDIA ACTORS ARE CLOSELY CONNECTED   WITHIN THE NETWORK, AND RECIPROCAL COMMUNICATION OF THESE ESTABLISHED   AGENTS IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COMPARED TO CITIZEN AGENTS.

THE REASON FOR THIS   OMISSION MAY BE DUE TO THE GOVERNING NATIONAL PARTY'S HISTORIC DISREGARD   FOR PUBLIC SERVICE BROADCASTING, AS DEMONSTRATED BY ITS DISESTABLISHMENT   OF A NUMBER OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING INITIATIVES SINCE 1999.

TO ADDRESS THESE   QUESTIONS, SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED TO EXAMINE THE NETWORKS   OF SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND (CYBER)BULLYING AMONG AN ENTIRE GRADE OF   1,458 THIRTEEN-TO FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD PUPILS. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT (1)   CYBERBULLYING IS AN EXTENSION OF TRADITIONAL BULLYING AS VICTIMS OFTEN   FACE THE SAME PERPETRATORS OFFLINE AND ONLINE, (2) THERE IS EVIDENCE OF   MUTUAL CYBERBULLYING AMONG YOUNGSTERS, AND (3) CYBERBULLYING IS MORE   LIKELY TO OCCUR IN SAME-GENDER AND SAME-CLASS STUDENTS.

IT ANALYSES   LONGITUDINAL PANEL DATA IN ORDER TO EXPLORE HOW YOUNG PEOPLE'S PUBLIC   ORIENTATION DEVELOPS DURING A PHASE IN LIFE (13-20) WHICH IS CRITICAL   FOR POLITICAL SOCIALIZATION. DATA ARE DERIVED FROM THREE WAVES OF DATA   COLLECTION AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WERE 13-17 YEARS OLD AT THE TIME FOR   THE FIRST DATA COLLECTION. THE CONCEPT PUBLIC ORIENTATION IS MEASURED BY   THREE INDICATORS: YOUNG PEOPLE'S VALUES, INTERESTS AND EVERYDAY PEER   TALK. THESE INDICATORS ARE ANALYSED WITH REFERENCE TO RESPONDENTS'   INTERNET ORIENTATIONS, WHICH WE CONCEPTUALIZE AS FOUR SEPARATE BUT   INTER-RELATED SPACES (A NEWS SPACE, A SPACE FOR SOCIAL INTERACTION, A   GAME SPACE AND A CREATIVE SPACE). THE RESULTS PRIMARILY EMPHASIZE THE   IMPORTANCE OF ORIENTATIONS TOWARDS NEWS SPACE AND SPACE FOR SOCIAL   INTERACTION. OVERALL, THE FINDINGS STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT ORIENTATIONS   TOWARDS THESE SPACES ARE RELATED TO ADOLESCENTS' PUBLIC ORIENTATION. THE   FINDINGS CONFIRM THE CENTRALITY OF NEWS AND INFORMATION IN POLITICAL   SOCIALIZATION, BUT THEY ALSO CHALLENGE THE IDEA THAT SOCIAL MEDIA   FACILITIES - SUCH AS FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND BLOGGING - ENABLE FORMS OF   SOCIAL INTERACTION AND CREATIVE PRODUCTION THAT HAVE AN OVERALL POSITIVE   IMPACT ON YOUNG PEOPLE'S PUBLIC ORIENTATION.","OLSSON, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), LUND UNIV, DEPT COMMUN \& MEDIA, S-22100 LUND, SWEDEN.;   EKSTROM, MATS, GOTHENBURG UNIV, DEPT JOURNALISM MEDIA \& COMMUN, GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN.;   OLSSON, TOBIAS, LUND UNIV, DEPT COMMUN \& MEDIA, S-22100 LUND, SWEDEN.;   SHEHATA, ADAM, MID SWEDEN UNIV, DEPT INFORMAT \& TECHNOL \& MEDIA, SUNDSVALL, SWEDEN.","ALLISON PD, 2009, FIXED EFFECTS REGRES.

USING   SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES, THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE NETWORK   STRUCTURE, THE FORMATION OF FOLLOWER RELATIONS AND INFORMATION   DIFFUSION. IT REVEALS THAT MICRO-BLOGGING IS AN IMPORTANT ONLINE   PLATFORM BECAUSE IT CAN CONVENIENTLY AND INEXPENSIVELY FOSTER PUBLIC   ONLINE ISSUE-NETWORKS BEYOND GEOGRAPHICAL BOUNDARIES. SPECIFICALLY,   WEIBO HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ENABLE CROSS-PROVINCE NETWORKING AND   COMMUNICATION, ALTHOUGH GEOGRAPHICAL PROXIMITY IS STILL AT WORK; THE   TRUSTWORTHINESS OF MICRO-BLOG USERS INDIRECTLY CONTRIBUTES TO   INFORMATION DIFFUSION BY FACILITATING THE FORMATION OF FOLLOWER   RELATIONS; AND ISSUE-SPECIFIC FOLLOWER NETWORKS FACILITATE INFORMATION   DIFFUSION PERTINENT TO THE ISSUE AT STAKE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT   MICRO-BLOGGING SERVICES MIGHT HAVE LONG-TERM EFFECTS ON COLLECTIVE   ACTION BY FOSTERING ISSUE-NETWORKS AMONG CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS OR   ACTIVISTS IN DIFFERENT PROVINCES.","HUANG, RG (REPRINT AUTHOR), FUDAN UNIV, DEPT SOCIOL, 220 HANDAN RD, SHANGHAI 200433, PEOPLES R CHINA.;   HUANG, RONGGUI, FUDAN UNIV, DEPT SOCIOL, SHANGHAI 200433, PEOPLES R CHINA.;   SUN, XIAOYI, CITY UNIV HONG KONG, DEPT PUBL POLICY, KOWLOON, HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.","BARASH V., 2011, ANAL SOCIAL MEDIA NE, P143.

THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT SOCIAL MEDIATORS VARY   IN TERMS OF THEIR FORMALITY AND INTERDEPENDENCE. FORMAL SOCIAL MEDIATORS   WERE PRIMARILY US GOVERNMENT AGENCIES WHILE INFORMAL SOCIAL MEDIATORS   WERE NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) AND INDIVIDUALS. NOTABLY,   RELATIONSHIPS WITH POPULATIONS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA WERE   MEDIATED PRIMARILY BY INFORMAL ACTORS, AND FORMAL MEDIATORS PLAYED A KEY   ROLE IN CONNECTING THE PUBLIC WITH EVERYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD.   GOVERNMENT-RELATED FORMAL MEDIATORS AND INFORMAL SOCIAL MEDIATORS SHOWED   SIMILAR LEVELS OF BILATERAL RELATIONSHIPS.

A NETWORK SENSIBILITY   RESONATES WITH CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL MEDIA CONTEXTS IN THAT IT FOCUSES   LESS ON DISCRETE OBJECTS AND MORE ON THE ENTANGLEMENTS AMONG ELEMENTS   THAT MAY CREATE MEANING.

THIS STUDY, ON THE OTHER HAND, TAKES   SUCH FORMS OF SYMBOLIC RESISTANCE INTO ACCOUNT. IT RELIES ON A   COMPARATIVE DISCURSIVE NETWORK ANALYSIS OF TEXTS PRODUCED BY CORPORATE   NEWS ORGANIZATIONS AND OF BLOGS REPRESENTING PRO-PIRACY PERSPECTIVES. IT   IS CONCLUDED THAT WITH THE BLURRING OF THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN PRODUCERS   AND CONSUMERS OF CONTENT, MORE AND MORE LOCALIZED MORAL PANICS THAT ARE   NOT NECESSARILY HEGEMONIC ARE LIKELY TO BE SEEN. PANIC REACTIONS CAN RUN   NOT ONLY FROM THE TOP DOWN BUT ALSO FROM THE BOTTOM UP AS NICHE AND   MICRO MEDIA INSTIGATE THEIR OWN MORAL PANICS.","LINDGREN, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UMEA UNIV, DEPT SOCIOL, SE-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.;   UMEA UNIV, DEPT SOCIOL, SE-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.","ALLAN S., 2009, CITIZEN JOURNALISM G.

INTEGRAL TO THE   RESEARCH WAS AN EXAMINATION OF STRUCTURAL BARRIERS AND   INTER-ORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT ACT TO FACILITATE THE TAKE-UP,   OR OTHERWISE, OF TECHNOLOGY. THEORY REGARDING THE DIFFUSION OF   INNOVATIONS AND SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS PROVIDED THE BACKGROUND. THE   QUALITATIVE METHOD CHOSEN FOR THE STUDY WAS CONSTRUCTIVIST GROUNDED   THEORY. THE SAMPLE WAS PURPOSIVELY SELECTED AND DATA COLLECTION INCLUDED   SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH KEY ACTORS; THE MAPPING OF   ORGANIZATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS; AND THE EXAMINATION OF WEBSITES. THE   FINDINGS INDICATE THAT ORGANIZATIONS WITH A COMBINATION OF GOOD INTERNAL   SKILLS, AND STRONG ACCESS TO EXTERNAL ADVICE AND SKILLS ARE IN THE BEST   POSITION TO CREATE WEBSITES THAT SATISFY THEIR NEEDS, WITH GOOD ACCESS   TO EXTERNAL INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY SERVICES AND ADVICE   MORE IMPORTANT THAN STRONG INTERNAL SKILLS. ORGANIZATIONS MUST ALSO   CONSIDER HOW TO DEAL WITH SIX BROAD AREAS RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND   MAINTENANCE OF WEBSITES: STRATEGY; TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE AND DESIGN;   PROJECT MANAGEMENT; SUPPORT; TRAINING; AND FUNDING.

AMONG SEVERAL CHALLENGES,   THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW BASE STATION SITES BECOMES CHALLENGING AND   EXPENSIVE. THIS STUDY PROPOSES AND ANALYZES CRITICAL ASPECTS OF A   BUSINESS CASE WHERE A MOBILE OPERATOR OFFLOADS ITS MOBILE LTE NETWORK BY   DEPLOYING COGNITIVE FEMTOCELLS. WHEN AIDED BY A SENSOR NETWORK THE   COGNITIVE FEMTOCELL WILL BE ABLE TO USE FREQUENCIES OTHER THAN THE   MOBILE NETWORK AND HENCE INCREASE ITS POWER TO COVER OUTDOOR AREAS AND   NEIGHBOUR BUILDINGS. THIS COGNITIVE FEMTOCELL STRATEGY WILL BE COMPARED   WITH AN ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY WHERE AN OPERATOR DEPLOYS CONVENTIONAL   FEMTOCELLS AND HAS TO BUILD ADDITIONAL BASE STATIONS TO MEET THE TRAFFIC   DEMANDS. THE BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS ILLUSTRATES THAT THERE IS A   POTENTIAL FOR COST SAVINGS WHEN OFFLOADING THE MOBILE NETWORK WITH   COGNITIVE FEMTOCELLS WHEN COMPARED TO THE ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY. IT MUST   BE EMPHASIZED THAT THE STUDIED CONCEPT IS INNOVATIVE AND THAT THE   BUSINESS CASE PERIOD STARTS IN 2017, HENCE, PARAMETER ASSUMPTIONS ARE   UNCERTAIN. THEREFORE, AS THE MOST IMPORTANT MESSAGE OF THIS WORK,   SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS USED TO REVEAL THE MOST CRITICAL ASPECTS OF THE   COGNITIVE FEMTOCELL BUSINESS CASE. IT IS FOUND THAT THE MOST CRITICAL   PARAMETERS REGARDING THE COGNITIVE FEMTOCELL ARE THE PRICE FOR   BACKHAULING, THE NUMBER OF USERS SUPPORTED AND THE COVERAGE.   FURTHERMORE, AN OPTIMAL COVERAGE RADIUS FOR THE COGNITIVE FEMTOCELL FOR   LOWEST POSSIBLE COSTS IS FOUND. COSTS RELATED TO THE FIXED SENSOR   NETWORK ARE FOUND TO BE LESS CRITICAL SINCE SENSORS ARE EMBEDDED IN THE   COGNITIVE FEMTOCELLS. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS IS ALSO PRESENTED FOR   SPECTRAL EFFICIENCY, COGNITIVE AND CONVENTIONAL FEMTOCELL OFFLOADING   GAIN, SENSOR DENSITY AND PRICE, CUSTOMER DENSITY AND PRICE FOR BASE   STATION SITE ESTABLISHMENT.

THE NETWORK STRUCTURE OF NEWS LINKS   CLEARLY EXHIBITS ITS KEY POSITION AS THE CENTERPIECE OF A GLOBAL SYSTEM.

THE AUTHORS ADDRESS THE QUESTION IN TERMS OF ALLIANCE FORMATION.   THEY APPLY NETWORK ANALYSIS, WHICH VISUALIZES THE FORMATION AND   TRANSFORMATION OF ALLIANCES. THEY ARGUE THAT CHINA'S APPROACH TO   STANDARDIZATION HAS EVOLVED FROM TECHNO-NATIONALISM TO TECHNO-GLOBALISM.   IN BUILDING, DEVELOPING, AND MAINTAINING ALLIANCES, RELATIVELY MORE   WEIGHT IS PLACED ON LINKS WITH FOREIGN FIRMS OVER TIME THAN ON THOSE   WITH LOCAL FIRMS, AND CHINA IS INCREASINGLY OPEN TO FOREIGN FIRMS TO   GAIN THEIR SUPPORT AND COOPERATION, WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR INTERNATIONAL   STANDARDIZATION AND COMMERCIALIZATION OF LOCALLY-DEVELOPED STANDARDS.

THIS EXPONENTIAL GROWTH MIGHT BE HINDERED BY A SCARCITY OF   SUITABLE RADIO SPECTRUM, A NECESSARY BUT LIMITED NATURAL RESOURCE   REQUIRED FOR ALL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS. SPECTRUM SCARCITY DOES NOT   ONLY SLOW DOWN DATA GROWTH, BUT MAY ALSO DISRUPT EXISTING   COMMUNICATIONS. COGNITIVE RADIO MAY PROVIDE A SOLUTION TO THESE ISSUES,   BUT ALTHOUGH THE CONCEPT SEEMS PROMISING, FEW PRODUCTS MAKING USE OF CR   HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO THE MARKET. THIS IS DUE TO SIGNIFICANT   UNCERTAINTIES SURROUNDING THE APPROPRIATE ECONOMIC SCENARIO FOR CR, THE   REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND THE TECHNOLOGY ENABLERS NEEDED FOR SUCH CR   SCENARIO. AS BUSINESS, REGULATORY AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS ARE LARGELY   CO-DETERMINED BY EACH OTHER, THIS PAPER PROPOSES TO ALIGN THEM, PAVING   THE ROAD FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SPECIFIC ECONOMIC SCENARIOS WITH   APPROPRIATE REGULATION. FIRST, FROM THE BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE, A TAXONOMY   OF POSSIBLE ECONOMIC SCENARIOS FOR CR IS PROPOSED. SECOND, FOR EACH   SCENARIO A NUMBER OF REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS - BASED ON A EUROPEAN   CONTEXT - AND CHARACTERISTICS ARE GIVEN. IN DOING SO, IT IS ARGUED THAT   THE ECONOMIC SCENARIOS ARE INHERENTLY DISTINCT SO THAT CR REGULATION   SHOULD BE CUSTOMIZED FOR THE TYPE OF SCENARIO ENVISAGED. THIRD, FROM THE   TECHNOLOGY PERSPECTIVE, THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE POSSIBLE CR ENABLERS,   SHOWING THAT SPECTRUM SENSING, CPC AND GEOLOCATION DATABASE ALL HAVE   THEIR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, AND RECEIVE VARYING SUPPORT FROM   BUSINESS AND REGULATORS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT,   ALTHOUGH THE INTRODUCTION OF CR DOES NOT SEEM PROBLEMATIC FOR THE   UNLICENSED SCENARIO AND THE FLEXIBLE OPERATOR SCENARIO, MORE COMPLEX   MEASURES ARE REQUIRED TO ENABLE CR TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE IMPLEMENTATION   OF SPECTRUM POOL AND SPECTRUM MARKET SCENARIOS. IT CAN ALSO BE CONCLUDED   THAT, OUT OF THE THREE PROPOSED ALTERNATIVES, THE GEOLOCATION DATABASE   IS THE MOST LIKELY CANDIDATE TO BE USED FOR CR PURPOSES. HOWEVER,   ALTHOUGH THIS DATABASE IS A CLEAR FAVORITE FOR APPLICATIONS WITHIN THE   TV WHITE SPACES, SPECTRUM SENSING SHOULD NOT BE DISCARDED AS A POTENTIAL   CR ENABLER FOR HIGHLY SENSITIVE APPLICATIONS IN HIGH-DENSITY RADIO   ENVIRONMENTS.

THROUGH BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSES, THIS STUDY SEEKS TO   UNRAVEL THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE STATE AND MEDIA IN CHINA'S MARCH   TOWARD MODERNIZATION BY EXAMINING COVERAGE OF RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN   PEOPLE'S DAILY (PD). FROM 1997 TO 2006, CHINA'S CENTRAL PARTY ORGAN   REPORTED AN ENORMOUS INCREASE IN THE CENTRAL OFFICIALS' EFFORTS TO BOOST   THE RURAL INCOME, BUT HIGHLIGHTED IN A HIERARCHICAL WAY THEIR   RESPONSIVENESS ACCORDING TO THE LOGICS OF PERIOD, REGION, AND THE TASK.   IN ITS ASSESSMENT OF RURAL ANOMALIES, THE RESPONSIBILITY WAS DEVOLVED TO   LOCAL BUREAUCRACIES, HENCE SHIFTING THE BLAME AWAY FROM THE CENTRAL   AUTHORITY. A DISCOURSE ANALYSIS SHOWED THE PD STUCK TO A CONTOUR OF   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTALISM THAT UPHELD INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY AS THE   PANACEA, AND PERPETUATED THE STATE'S REDISTRIBUTIVE ROLE AS THE KEY TO   SOCIAL EQUALITY. AS SUCH, THE OVERTLY PROPAGANDIST RHETORIC HAS BEEN   INCREASINGLY GIVING WAY TO A COHERENT SET OF FRAMING PRACTICES THAT   RATIONALIZE THE CENTRALITY OF THE PARTY-STATE IN CHINA.","SONG, YY (REPRINT AUTHOR), CITY UNIV HONG KONG, DEPT MEDIA \& COMMUN, 18 TAT HONG AVE, KOWLOON, HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.;   SONG, YUNYA, CITY UNIV HONG KONG, DEPT MEDIA \& COMMUN, KOWLOON, HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.;   SONG, YUNYA, NANJING UNIV, SCH JOURNALISM \& COMMUN, NANJING, PEOPLES R CHINA.","ALEXSEEV MA, 1995, POLIT COMMUN, V12, P395, DOI 10.1080/10584609.1995.9963086.

HYPOTHESES/EXPECTATIONS WERE DERIVED FROM NETWORK THEORY AND   (QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE) STUDIES ON THE SOCIAL AFFORDANCES OF   COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES FOR ADOLESCENTS. DATA WERE COLLECTED AMONG   THE 78 PUPILS OF A FOURTH GRADE (15-16-YEAR-OLDS) IN A BELGIAN SECONDARY   SCHOOL. FIRST, DYADIC QUADRATIC ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURE REGRESSION ANALYSES   WERE RUN TO EXPLAIN THE FREQUENCY OF FTFC AND COMMUNICATION THROUGH   DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES BY LOOKING AT DYAD CHARACTERISTICS (STRENGTH OF   TIES, NUMBER OF FRIENDS IN COMMON, SAME SEX. . .). SECOND, FTFC AND   COMMUNICATION THROUGH TECHNOLOGIES WERE COMPARED FOR IN-GROUP VERSUS   OUT-GROUP TIES. THE ANALYSES SHOW THAT THE PATTERNS OF FTFC WERE   SOMETIMES REPRODUCED (AND THEREFORE EXTENDED), AND SOMETIMES DEVIATED   FROM IN COMMUNICATION THROUGH TECHNOLOGIES.

SPECIFICALLY, SES AFFECTS THE ACCESS INDIVIDUALS HAVE TO BENEFICIAL   RESOURCES THAT INDIRECTLY AFFECTS THE SOCIAL CAPITAL BENEFITS   INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE FROM PERSONAL AND GROUP SOCIAL NETWORKS. WITH THE   ADVENT OF SOCIAL NETWORK SITES LIKE FACEBOOK, THE ABILITY TO QUANTIFY   AND MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF SES ON SOCIAL CAPITAL BENEFITS IS POSSIBLE TO   A MUCH GREATER DEGREE THAN EVER BEFORE. THIS STUDY OF UNDERGRADUATE   STUDENTS FOCUSES ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SES AND SOCIAL CAPITAL. WE   EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SES AND THREE STRUCTURAL MEASURES OF   STUDENTS' SOCIAL CAPITAL USING ONLINE SOCIAL NETWORK DATA: GENERAL   SOCIAL CAPITAL (NETWORK SIZE), BRIDGING SOCIAL CAPITAL (NUMBER OF   CLUSTERS), AND BONDING SOCIAL CAPITAL (AVERAGE DEGREE). ACCORDING TO OUR   RESULTS, HIGHER SES RELATES TO LARGER AND DENSER NETWORKS, BUT NOT TO   NETWORKS WITH MORE CLUSTERS. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT SES IS NOT   RELATED TO GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR NETWORKING, BUT BETTER   CAPITALIZATION OF EXISTING NETWORK CONTEXTS. IN ADDITION TO THE NOVEL   SUBSTANTIVE CONTRIBUTION, THIS PAPER OFFERS A METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCE IN   THE STRUCTURAL STUDY OF SOCIAL CAPITAL, WHICH HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN   LIMITED IN SIZE OR COMPLEXITY DUE TO RECALL.","BROOKS, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, MEDIA \& INFORMAT STUDIES PROGRAM, DEPT TELECOMMUN MEDIA \& INFORMAT STUDIES, COMMUN ARTS \& SCI BLDG, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;   BROOKS, BRANDON, MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, MEDIA \& INFORMAT STUDIES PROGRAM, DEPT TELECOMMUN MEDIA \& INFORMAT STUDIES, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;   TITSWORTH, SCOTT, OHIO UNIV, SCH COMMUN STUDIES, ATHENS, OH 45701 USA.;   HOGAN, BERNIE, UNIV OXFORD, OXFORD INTERNET INST, OXFORD OX1 3JS, ENGLAND.","BOURDIEU P, 1986, HDB THEORY RES SOCIO, P241, DOI DOI 10.1002/9780470755679.CH15.

IT BEGINS BY CONCEPTUALIZING   LARGE-SCALE PATTERNS OF MEDIA USE IN NETWORK TERMS, TREATING MEDIA   OUTLETS AS NODES AND THE LEVELS OF AUDIENCE DUPLICATION AMONG THEM AS   LINKS. FOLLOWING THAT, IT EXPLAINS 2 COMMON MEASURES OF AUDIENCE   DUPLICATION, ABSOLUTE DUPLICATION AND PRIMARY DUPLICATION, AND OFFERS A   NEW MEASURE, DEVIATION-FROM-RANDOM DUPLICATION. IN DOING SO, TECHNIQUES   FOR CONVERTING DUPLICATION DATA INTO NETWORK DATA ARE DISCUSSED. THIS   APPROACH IS THEN APPLIED TO ANALYZE PATTERNS OF AUDIENCE FRAGMENTATION,   MEDIA PUBLICS, AND AUDIENCE POLARIZATION USING DATA FROM NIELSEN'S   TV/INTERNET CONVERGENCE PANEL. THE FINDINGS SHOW THE VALUE OF USING A   NETWORK APPROACH, BY CONTRIBUTING TO AN ALTERNATIVE UNDERSTANDING OF   THESE PATTERNS.

THIS RESEARCH APPLIES THE INTEGRATED   LENS OF THE ABSORPTIVE CAPACITY THEORY AND THE SOCIAL PROCESS MODEL OF   INFORMATION SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS TO EXAMINE THE DYNAMIC OF   KNOWLEDGE ACTIVITIES CONCERNING BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT IN   THE CONTEXT OF MUNICIPAL BROADBAND NETWORKS. THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS ARE:   (1) WHAT IS THE EXTENT OF THE DYNAMIC OF KNOWLEDGE ACTIVITIES INVOLVED   IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS?, (2) WHAT ARE THE EVENTS THAT TRIGGER   KNOWLEDGE ACTIVITIES IN MUNICIPAL BROADBAND DEVELOPMENT?, AND (3) HOW   DOES A CITY CREATE AND UTILIZE NEW KNOWLEDGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS?   THIS STUDY EXAMINES MUNICIPAL WIRELESS PROJECTS IN THREE CITIES (CHASKA,   MN; HERMOSA BEACH, CA; AND FREDERICTON, CANADA). EVENTS THAT TRIGGER   KNOWLEDGE ACTIVITIES ARE ASSIGNMENT OF PERSONNEL, PHYSICAL SYSTEM   CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS, RESISTANCE, AND REASSIGNMENT OF   ORGANIZATIONAL ROLES. FOUR FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE KNOWLEDGE ACTIVITIES   AND PROJECT PERFORMANCE ARE THE DYNAMIC OF TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT,   PARTNERSHIP COMMITMENTS, LIMITATION OF EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE AND   LEARNING-BY-DOING, AND POLITICAL DYNAMICS. THE STUDY HAS POLICY   IMPLICATIONS FOR CITIES THAT ARE IN THE PROCESS OF PLANNING AND   DEPLOYMENT. A GOOD PROJECT PLANNING, USER EXPECTATION MANAGEMENT,   SYSTEMATIC PERFORMANCE EVALUATION, A CAREFUL PARTNER SELECTION PROCESS,   AND THE USE OF SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS ARE IMPORTANT TO PROJECT   SUCCESS. IN ADDITION, CITIES NEED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE   TECHNOLOGY IS NOT A PLUG AND PLAY TECHNOLOGY AND THAT CONSIDERABLE   EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO INTEGRATE THE TECHNOLOGY WITH OTHER SOLUTIONS TO   DELIVER BROADBAND SERVICES AS WELL AS TO CONFIGURE THE SYSTEM ACCORDING   TO TOPOLOGIES, STREET CONDITIONS, BUILDINGS, DENSITY OF TREES, AMONG   OTHERS.

THIS MEASURE   HAS BEEN WIDELY USED IN ACADEMIC AND POLICY RESEARCH TO ASSESS   AVAILABILITY AND TO IDENTIFY UNDER-SERVED AREAS, BUT IT IS ACKNOWLEDGED   TO BE FLAWED AND IS OFTEN MISINTERPRETED.   THIS PAPER DEVELOPS AN ALTERNATIVE MEASURE OF RESIDENTIAL BROADBAND   AVAILABILITY. USING THE DECEMBER 2005 FCC DATA AND INDIVIDUAL BROADBAND   ADOPTION DATA FROM FORRESTER RESEARCH, THE PAPER ESTIMATES A   RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF PROVIDERS IN A ZIP CODE AND THE LEVEL   OF RESIDENTIAL BROADBAND AVAILABILITY IN THE ZIP CODE.   BROADBAND IS ESTIMATED TO BE AVAILABLE TO 53\% OF HOUSEHOLDS IN ZIP   CODES WITH 1-3 PROVIDERS, RISING TO 100\% IN ZIP CODES WITH 14 OR MORE   PROVIDERS. AGGREGATING THESE ESTIMATES AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL IMPLIES   THAT BROADBAND WAS AVAILABLE TO 85\% OF HOUSEHOLDS IN DECEMBER 2005.   AVAILABILITY WAS HIGHEST IN SOUTHERN AND WESTERN METROPOLITAN AREAS LIKE   MIAMI AND SAN JOSE. USING THESE ESTIMATES OF AVAILABILITY, POPULATION   DENSITY AND AVERAGE INCOME BOTH HAVE POSITIVE AND HIGHLY STATISTICALLY   SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON BROADBAND SUPPLY.   THE RESULTS PROVIDE A USER-FRIENDLY TOOL TO HELP POLICYMAKERS ASSESS   BROADBAND AVAILABILITY. THE ESTIMATES ARE ALSO USEFUL FOR FUTURE   RESEARCH ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF BROADBAND AVAILABILITY.

ANALYSIS   WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH NEURAL NETWORK ANALYSIS WITH THE CATPAC COMPUTER   PROGRAM. ON THE ONE HAND, SUPPORTERS OF THE POLICY USE A `DEVELOPMENT   FRAME' WHICH DEFINES POPULATION AS A PROBLEM BORNE OUT OF PEOPLE HAVING   LARGE FAMILIES; IT IS ARGUED THAT UNCHECKED POPULATION GROWTH NEGATIVELY   IMPACTS ON DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES SUCH AS EDUCATION AND INCOME. IN THE   DEVELOPMENT FRAME, THE PROPOSED SOLUTION IS TO INSTITUTE A POPULATION   MANAGEMENT POLICY THAT PROMOTES FAMILY PLANNING (CONTRACEPTIVE USE) TO   HELP FILIPINOS ACHIEVE THEIR DESIRED FAMILY SIZE. OPPONENTS ON THE OTHER   HAND USE TWO FRAMES, ONE WHICH EQUATES THE POLICIES WITH ABORTION, AND   ANOTHER WHICH ARGUES THAT SUCH POLICIES WILL LEAD TO A DEGRADATION OF   MORAL VALUES. RESULTS DELINEATE THE COMPETING FRAMES FROM BOTH SIDES AND   SHOW THAT THE MEDIA FRAME REFLECTS BOTH VIEWS, BUT THAT THE DISCOURSE IS   PRESENTED AS CONFLICT.","DAVID, CC (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV PHILIPPINES, COLL MASS COMMUN, QUEZON CITY 1101, PHILIPPINES.;   DAVID, CLARISSA C., UNIV PHILIPPINES, COLL MASS COMMUN, QUEZON CITY 1101, PHILIPPINES.;   ATUN, JENNA MAE L., ATENEO MANILA UNIV, DEPT COMMUN, QUEZON CITY, PHILIPPINES.;   LA VINA, ANTONIO G.

SEVENTY-TWO PICTURES WERE SELECTED FROM THE   INTERNATIONAL AFFECTIVE PICTURE SYSTEM (IAPS) USING VALENCE AND AROUSAL   NORMS PUBLISHED WITH THE SYSTEM. RECOGNITION WAS USED TO TRACK ENCODING.   RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CENTRAL DETAILS ARE RECOGNIZED BETTER THAN   PERIPHERAL DETAILS AS AROUSAL INCREASES. THE ENCODING OF CENTRAL   COMPARED TO PERIPHERAL DETAIL IS LESS PRONE TO COGNITIVE OVERLOAD. THE   FINDINGS REVEAL A REMARKABLE HIERARCHY THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE   MOTIVATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ON COGNITION AND SUGGESTS THAT AS EMOTIONAL   EXPERIENCE INTENSIFIES THE ORGANISM GIVES UP ON ENCODING FOR PERIPHERAL   NEGATIVE DETAIL SOONER AND MORE RAPIDLY THAN FOR PERIPHERAL POSITIVE   DETAIL.","YEGIYAN, NS (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CALIF DAVIS, DEPT COMMUN, 1 SHIELDS AVE, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA.;   YEGIYAN, NARINE S., UNIV CALIF DAVIS, DEPT COMMUN, DAVIS, CA 95616 USA.;   LANG, ANNIE, INDIANA UNIV, INST COMMUN, DEPT TELECOMMUN, BLOOMINGTON, IN USA.","BRADLEY MA, 2003, BEHAV NEUROSCI, V117, P369, DOI 10.1037/0735-7044.117.2.369.

WEB LINKS BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONAL WEBSITES ARE USED AS A PROXY. INDEED,   EXTREMIST GROUPS INCREASINGLY USE AND ABUSE THE INTERNET FOR THEIR   PROPAGANDA AND THEIR RECRUITMENT, AND ALSO FOR THEIR INTERNAL   COMMUNICATION. THE ANALYSIS INCLUDES BOTH POLITICAL PARTIES AND   NON-PARTY ORGANIZATIONS, EVEN VIOLENT GROUPS. IN A MACRO-, MICRO-, AND   MESO-ANALYSIS, THE VARIOUS SPECIFICITIES OF THE TWO NATIONAL POLITICAL   SECTORS ARE DEMONSTRATED AND LINKED TO THE OFFLINE REALITY. THE ITALIAN   NETWORK APPEARS TO BE VERY FRAGMENTED, HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED, AND DIFFICULT   TO BE COORDINATED ('POLICEPHALOUS NETWORK'), WHEREAS THE GERMAN NETWORK   IS DENSER AND MUCH MORE CONCENTRATED ON A FEW CENTRAL ACTORS ('STAR   STRUCTURE'). THESE DIFFERENCES ARE MAINLY DUE TO POLITICAL OPPORTUNITY   STRUCTURES IN THE TWO COUNTRIES. ADDITIONALLY, WHEREAS THE ITALIAN   NETWORK STRUCTURE ALLOWS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A TYPOLOGY OF   SUB-GROUPS OF ORGANIZATIONS, THE GERMAN COMMUNICATIVE STRUCTURE SEEMS TO   BE MORE ERRATIC AND LESS COORDINATED. THE ARTICLE ALSO HIGHLIGHTS THE   FUNCTION OF WEBSITES WHICH ARE NOT RELATED TO ANY SPECIFIC GROUP.   INDEED, THESE ARE OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE FOR THE FAR RIGHT AS A POLITICAL   ARENA WHICH IS USUALLY BANNED FROM THE DOMINANT SOCIETAL DISCOURSES (IF   NOT EVEN LEGALLY FORBIDDEN). CONSIDERING THIS, NEW MODES OF   COMMUNICATION CAN BE OF GREATER USE FOR EXTREMIST GROUPS THAN FOR MORE   TRADITIONAL POLITICAL ACTORS.","CAIANI, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), EUROPEAN UNIV INST, VIA ROCCETTINI 9, I-50014 S DOMENICO DI FIESOLE, FI, ITALY.;   CAIANI, MANUELA, WAGEMANN, CLAUDIUS, EUROPEAN UNIV INST, I-50014 S DOMENICO DI FIESOLE, FI, ITALY.","BACKES U, 1994, EXTREME RECHTE DTSCH.

AT   THE END OF 2005-2006, THERE WERE 90 MILLION MOBILE SUBSCRIBERS IN INDIA   IN COMPARISON TO 50 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS FOR LANDLINES. THE INCREASE IN   MOBILE PHONES HAS BEEN PHENOMENAL IN COMPARISON WITH LANDLINES SINCE THE   INTRODUCTION OF MOBILES IN THE COUNTRY. THE MAIN AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO   ESTIMATE FUTURE TRENDS AND ANALYZE THE PATTERN AND RATE OF ADOPTION OF   MOBILE PHONES IN INDIA. THE PAPER USES S-SHAPED GROWTH CURVE MODELS FOR   THE SAME. IT IS FOUND THAT MOBILE-DENSITY (NUMBER OF MOBILE PHONES PER   100 INHABITANTS) IN INDIA WILL INCREASE FROM 8.1 IN 2005-2006 TO 36.5 IN   2010-2011 AND 71 IN 2015-2016. CONSEQUENTLY, THE MOBILE SUBSCRIBER BASE   IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE FROM 90 MILLION IN 2005-2006 TO 433 MILLION IN   2010-2011 AND NEARLY 900 MILLION IN 2015-2016. THE PROJECTED RAPID   GROWTH IN THE MOBILE SUBSCRIBER BASE WILL HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS   FOR FUTURE PLANS OF MOBILE OPERATORS, INFRASTRUCTURE PROVIDERS, HANDSET   SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS. MOBILE OPERATORS SHOULD BE READY WITH CONTINGENCY   PLANS TO DEPLOY AND OPERATE INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING CUSTOMER CARE,   BILLING, APPLICATIONS, ETC., FASTER THAN THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE INITIALLY   PLANNED.

USING SAMPLING FROM THE BLOG SIDEBAR HYPERLINKS OF ELECTED   POLITICIANS (NATIONAL ASSEMBLYMEN), THE TOP 79 ELITE CITIZEN BLOGS WERE   SELECTED. TWO DATA SETS WERE MANUALLY COMPILED DURING JANUARY, 2007: (A)   LINKS BETWEEN POLITICIANS AND CITIZENS, AND (B) LINKS AMONGST CITIZENS.   A VARIETY OF SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYTICAL METHODS WERE THEN APPLIED. THE   RESULTS SHOW THAT MORE TOP BLOGS HAVE RECIPROCAL LINKS WITH POLITICIANS   THAN HAVE UNIDIRECTIONAL LINKS. THE STRUCTURE OF HYPERLINK   INTERCONNECTIVITY SUGGESTS THAT THE RULING URI PARTY AFFILIATED BLOGS   ARE KEY IN THE BLOG NETWORK. FOR EXAMPLE, THE BLOGS TIED WITH THE URI   PARTY HAVE A HIGHER CENTRALITY AND ARE MORE DENSELY CONNECTED. NETWORK   DIAGRAMS ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE TOP BLOGS ARE POLARIZED BY PARTY.   HOWEVER, SOME BLOGS ARE LOCATED AT THE CENTER OF THE URI AND GNP   CLUSTERS AND ARE CONNECTED TO BOTH CAMPS. IN OTHER WORDS, THERE ARE A   NUMBER OF CITIZEN BLOGS THAT LINK TO BOTH THE URI AND GNP MEMBERS,   BECAUSE THEIR POLITICAL IDENTITIES ARE NOT COMPLETELY SHAPED BUT ALSO   REMAIN BETWEEN 2 DIFFERENT IDEOLOGIES. THIS SUGGESTS THAT BINARY   OPPOSITION IN ONLINE POLITICAL DISCOURSE IS SLOWLY CHANGING.","PARK, HW (REPRINT AUTHOR), YEUNGNAM UNIV, DEPT COMMUN \& INFORMAT, 214-1 DAE DONG, GYONGSAN 712749, GYEONGSANGBUK D, SOUTH KOREA.;   PARK, HAN WOO, YEUNGNAM UNIV, DEPT COMMUN \& INFORMAT, GYONGSAN 712749, GYEONGSANGBUK D, SOUTH KOREA.;   THELWALL, MIKE, WOLVERHAMPTON UNIV, SCH COMP \& IT, WOLVERHAMPTON WV1 1LY, W MIDLANDS, ENGLAND.;   THELWALL, MIKE, WOLVERHAMPTON UNIV, STAT CYBERMETR RES GRP, WOLVERHAMPTON WV1 1LY, W MIDLANDS, ENGLAND.","ADAMIC L, 2005, 2 ANN WORKSH WEBL EC.

THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE ADVANTAGES AND DIFFICULTIES OF STUDYING   ONLINE DISCUSSIONS APPLYING A MIXED METHOD APPROACH OF CONTENT ANALYSIS,   SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS AND LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS. THE ADDITIONAL VALUE   OF USING A COMBINATION OF RESEARCH METHODS SIMULTANEOUSLY IS THAT IT   DOES JUSTICE TO THE COMPLEX OBJECT OF STUDY BECAUSE A MORE IN-DEPTH AND   TRIANGULATED MEASUREMENT OF POLITICAL COMMUNICATIONS CAN BE ESTABLISHED.

IN THE ASIAN CONTEXT, THERE IS ALREADY AN IMPORTANT ROLE   FOR DIGITAL MEDIA IN THE POLITICAL ARENA AS PARTICIPATORY COMMUNICATION   CHANNELS IN HIGH-TECH COUNTRIES, SUCH AS SOUTH KOREA, AS WELL AS IN   TECHNOLOGICALLY LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES LIKE THE PHILIPPINES. IN   PARTICULAR, THE POLITICAL USE OF BLOGS HAS BEEN INCREASING DUE TO THE   POSSIBILITY TO PUBLISH MATERIAL ONLINE QUICKLY AND TO DISTRIBUTE CONTENT   WITH OTHER BLOGGERS. BECAUSE OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS, BLOGS ARE   PERCEIVED AS BOTH PERSONAL AND COLLABORATIVE MEDIA. THE RELATIONAL   ASPECTS OF BLOGS, HOWEVER, HAVE NOT BEEN SUFFICIENTLY EXPLORED. THAT IS   THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE AND, BASED ON DATA COLLECTED IN JULY AND   AUGUST 2005, TWO ANALYSES ARE PRESENTED. FIRST, WE EXAMINE CITIZEN BLOGS   THAT POLITICIANS FREQUENTLY VISIT. SECOND, WE ANALYSE THE CO-INLINKS TO   CITIZEN BLOGS AND ATTEMPT TO ASCERTAIN THE RELATION BETWEEN THESE   CO-INLINKS AND THE INTER-LINKAGE PATTERNS AMONG CITIZENS. THE FINDINGS   INDICATE THAT THE PREFERRED TARGET OF POLITICIANS' BLOGS IS MORE LIKELY   TO BE THOSE BLOGS MAINTAINED BY CITIZENS WHO EXPLICITLY EXPRESS A   POLITICAL STANCE. IN ADDITION, THE CO-INLINKS FROM A POLITICIAN'S LIST   OF NEIGHBOURS TO CITIZEN BLOGS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTER-LINKAGE   NETWORK STRUCTURE.","PARK, HW (REPRINT AUTHOR), YEUNGNAM UNIV, DEPT COMMUN \& INFORMAT, TAEGU, SOUTH KOREA.;   PARK, HAN WOO, YEUNGNAM UNIV, DEPT COMMUN \& INFORMAT, TAEGU, SOUTH KOREA.","ADAMIC LA, 2003, SOC NETWORKS, V25, P211, DOI 10.1016/S0378-8733(03)00009-1.

BUILDING ON SEO, PUTNAM, AND   BARTUNEK'S (2003) WORK, THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE DUALITIES ASSOCIATED   WITH MANAGING CHANGE PROCESSES. A CASE STUDY OF A PLANNED CHANGE PROCESS   CALLED THE CIRCLE OF PROSPERITY INITIATIVE, A MULTI-STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE   DESIGNED TO BRING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY TO INDIAN COUNTRY, WAS   ANALYZED. THREE DUALITIES EMERGED REGARDING THE STRUCTURING AND   MANAGEMENT OF THE CHANGE INITIATIVE: (1) INCLUSION-EXCLUSION, (2)   PRESERVATION-CHANGE, AND (3) CENTRALITY-PARITY. THE FINDINGS SUGGESTED   THAT THESE DUALITIES WERE MANAGED USING SEO ET AL.'S (2003) STRATEGY OF   CONNECTION. NOTABLY, THE STRATEGY OF CONNECTION RELIED HEAVILY ON THE   ABILITY OF CHANGE AGENTS TO SET CONTEXT WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT   PHASES OF THE INITIATIVE AND INVOLVED THREE SPECIFIC PRACTICES FOR   SETTING CONTEXT SETTING: (1) COMMONPLACING, (2) BOUNDED MUTUALITY, AND   (3) REFLEXIVE POSITIONING.","BARGE, JK (REPRINT AUTHOR), TEXAS A\&M UNIV, DEPT COMMUN, 209A BOLTON HALL, COLLEGE STN, TX 77843 USA.;   BARGE, J.

IT ARGUES THAT THIS   UNDERSTANDING OF DELIBERATIVE DEMOCRACY FAILS TO ADEQUATELY CONSIDER THE   ASYMMETRIES OF POWER THROUGH WHICH DELIBERATION AND CONSENSUS ARE   ACHIEVED, THE INTER- SUBJECTIVE BASIS OF MEANING, THE CENTRALITY OF   RESPECT FOR DIFFERENCE IN DEMOCRACY, AND THE DEMOCRATIC ROLE OF ` LIKE-   MINDED' DELIBERATIVE GROUPS. THE DELIBERATIVE PUBLIC SPHERE MUST BE   RETHOUGHT TO ACCOUNT MORE FULLY FOR THESE FOUR ASPECTS.

THIS PAPER TRIES TO MEASURE THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN   NANOTECHNOLOGY AND ITS RELATION TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN OTHER FIELDS   OF KNOWLEDGE BY APPLYING A NEW METHOD. I COMBINE FORMAL NETWORK ANALYSIS   OF CO-PURCHASE BOOK DATA WITH TRADITIONAL CONTENT ANALYSIS. THE METHOD   IS SUCCESSFUL IN IDENTIFYING THE BOOKS THAT THE PUBLIC READS TO BE   INFORMED ABOUT NANOTECHNOLOGY, AND IN DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN DIFFERENT   KINDS AND CLASSES OF BOOKS AND THEREBY BETWEEN DIFFERENT INTEREST FOCI   AND READERSHIPS AND THEIR RELATIONS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT   NANOTECHNOLOGY IS FOR MANY THEIR FIRST INTENSE CONTACT WITH SCIENCE AND   TECHNOLOGY AND THAT THEY READ A GREAT VARIETY OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF   BOOKS. RATHER THAN CHOOSE GENERAL INTRODUCTIONS TO CURRENT RESEARCH   WRITTEN BY SCIENTISTS OR SCIENCE JOURNALISTS, READERS FOCUS ON   FORECASTING AND VISIONARY LITERATURE INCLUDING BUSINESS GUIDES, WRITTEN   BY SOFTWARE ENTREPRENEURS AND BUSINESS CONSULTANTS. UNLIKE EXPERT   READERS, WHO CONNECT NANOTECHNOLOGY TO OTHER FIELDS OF SCIENCE AND   ENGINEERING, THE BROADER PUBLIC CONNECTS IT TO VISIONS ABOUT DISSOLVING   THE HUMAN/MACHINE DISTINCTION. ALTHOUGH THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN   NON-FICTION AND SCIENCE FICTION IS STILL IMPORTANT FOR READERS,   BORDER-CROSSING AUTHORS INCREASINGLY BLUR IT.","SCHUMMER, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV S CAROLINA, DEPT PHILOSOPHY, COLUMBIA, SC 29205 USA.;   UNIV S CAROLINA, DEPT PHILOSOPHY, COLUMBIA, SC 29205 USA.","ANDERSON A, 2004, C IM IM NAN SCI ENG.

IN THIS PAPER, CLUSTER   ANALYSIS AND RELATED STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES ARE USED ON A PANEL OF 61   COUNTRIES (REPRESENTING DIFFERENT REGIONS AND.

THE MAIN GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS   TO DEFINE A THEORETICAL MODEL FOR THE STUDY OF SEDUCTIVE PROCESSES ON   THE INTERNET. IN PARTICULAR, TAKING UP THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE USER, A   SHIFT OF FOCUS IS PROPOSED: FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF   INTERPERSONAL ATTRACTION TO THE INVESTIGATION OF SEDUCTION, CONSIDERED   AS A STRATEGIC COMMUNICATION PROCESS. ACCORDING TO THE PRESENTED MODEL,   THE KEY EFFORT OF THE SUBJECTS INVOLVED IN A COMPUTER-MEDIATED SEDUCTIVE   INTERACTION IS THE NEGOTIATION OF THE MEANING OF THE SITUATION THEY ARE   INVOLVED IN. THIS PROCESS USUALLY REQUIRES TWO TASKS: THE ANALYSIS OF   THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMMUNICATIVE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH THE PLAY   OF INTERPERSONAL ATTRACTION DEVELOPS, AND THE EXPLOITATION OF THE   AFFORDANCES OFFERED BY THE COMMUNICATIVE ENVIRONMENT ACCORDING TO   SPECIFIC STRATEGIC GOALS. THE MAIN FEATURES OF THE MODEL ARE BOTH THE   FOCUS ON THE COMMUNICATIVE TOOLS EMPLOYED BY THE USERS TO REACH THEIR   RELATIONAL GOALS, AND THE ERGONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE NETWORKED   ENVIRONMENT. THIS APPROACH CAN BE USED AS A TEST-BED FOR THE DEFINITION   OF SPECIFIC HYPOTHESES CONCERNING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEDUCTIVE   INTERACTION ONLINE.","MANTOVANI, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CATTOLICA SACRO CUORE, DEPT PSYCHOL, CTR STUDIES \& RES COMMUN PSYCHOL, LARGO GEMELLI 1, I-20123 MILAN, ITALY.;   UNIV CATTOLICA SACRO CUORE, DEPT PSYCHOL, CTR STUDIES \& RES COMMUN PSYCHOL, I-20123 MILAN, ITALY.","BAKER A, 2000, CYBERPSYCHOL BEHAV, V3, P237, DOI 10.1089/109493100316094.

SEVENTY EMPLOYEES FROM THREE   DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS WERE SURVEYED ABOUT THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARD THEIR   JOBS AND WERE ALSO ASKED TO INDICATE (BY CHECKLIST) WHICH EMPLOYEES THEY   SPOKE TO REGULARLY AT WORK. TURNOVER DATA WERE OBTAINED AT 3 AND 6   MONTHS TIME AFTER THE SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED. RESULTS GENERALLY   SUPPORTED THE EROSION MODEL OF EMPLOYEE TURNOVER. THOSE EMPLOYEES WITH   HIGH DEGREE OR NUMBER OF LINKS IN THE NETWORK WERE LESS LIKELY TO   TURNOVER. EMPLOYEES WHO REQUIRED FEWER LINKS TO COMMUNICATE TO ALL   OTHERS IN THE NETWORK (I.E., CLOSENESS) WERE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO   TURNOVER BUT THIS RELATIONSHIP ONLY APPROACHED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE   (P =.06). BETWEENNESS, DEFINED AS THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH A PERSON   FALLS BETWEEN PAIRS OF OTHER POSITIONS IN A NETWORK, WAS ALSO   SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO EMPLOYEE TURNOVER. IT WAS ALSO PREDICTED, BASED   ON FEELEY AND BARNETT'S EM, THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NETWORK   POSITION AND TURNOVER WOULD BE MEDIATED BY AN EMPLOYEE'S LEVEL OF   COMMITMENT TO THE ORGANIZATION AND HIS OR HER INTENTIONS TO LEAVE WORK.   CLOSENESS SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED COMMITMENT WHILE BETWEENNESS AND   DEGREE WERE UNRELATED TO COMMITMENT LEVELS. ORGANIZATIONAL COMMITMENT   WAS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO INTENTIONS TO LEAVE WORK AND, UNEXPECTEDLY,   COMMITMENT LEVELS WERE POSITIVELY RELATED TO EMPLOYEE TURNOVER.

THE SUCCESS OF THE MARKET OUTGREW ALL FORECASTS: BY THE END OF   1998 EACH OF MORE THAN ONE MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND USERS WERE   CONNECTED TO ONE OF SIX CELLULAR COMPANIES RAISING THE DENSITY INDICATOR   TO 4.75\%. THE NEW TECHNOLOGICAL POSSIBILITIES AND THE INCREASING DEMAND   FOR MOBILE SERVICES HAS OBLIGED THE MINISTRY OF COMMUNICATIONS TO BEGIN   A PROCESS OF SETTING THE REGULATORY AND TECHNOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK FOR PCS   SERVICES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE CELLULAR MARKETS   IN COLOMBIA AND ANALYZES THE MAIN ASPECTS OF THE TOPICS CONCERNING THE   DEFINITION OF THE RULES FOR THE PCS MARKETS: TECHNOLOGY, GEOGRAPHICAL   STRUCTURE OF THE FUTURE MARKETS AND LICENSE ASSIGNMENT PROCEDURES. AT   THE SAME TIME, BASED ON THE HUGE SUCCESS OF AUCTIONS FOR PCS LICENSING   IN OTHER COUNTRIES, THE PAPER IS CONCERNED WITH ASSESSING THE EXPECTED   REVENUES THAT THE COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT WOULD COLLECT SHOULD IT DECIDE TO   USE SIMULTANEOUS ASCENDING AUCTIONS. BENEFITS TO CONSUMERS WILL BE   APPARENT ONCE THE NEW PCS OPERATORS START OPERATING THEIR NETWORKS SINCE   IT IS CONCLUDED THAT, GIVEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SERVICES PROVIDED BY   THE CURRENT CELLULAR OPERATORS AND THE SIMILAR SERVICES TO BE OFFERED BY   THE NEW PCS PLAYERS, WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED CLOSE SUBSTITUTES, PRICE   WILL BE THE DISTINCTIVE ISSUE REGARDED BY CONSUMERS.

IN 1993, FOR   EXAMPLE, THE COUNTRY HAD ONLY 0.05 INTERNET HOSTS PER 10,000 PEOPLE,   WHILE CHILE HAD AS MANY AS 1.01 (BRAZIL HAD 0.27, MEXICO HAD 0.40 AND   VENEZUELA 0.23). BY JULY 1999, HOWEVER, THE SITUATION HAD CHANGED IN   SOME FUNDAMENTAL WAYS. WHILE COUNTRIES LIKE CHILE AND BRAZIL HAD 25   INTERNET HOSTS PER 10,000 PEOPLE, ARGENTINA WAS ENJOYING THE PRESENCE OF   ALMOST 39 INTERNET HOSTS PER 10,000 PEOPLE. THE NUMBER OF ESTIMATED   USERS HAD CLIMBED FROM SOME 70,000 IN LATE 1996 TO MORE THAN 900,000 IN   MID-1999; WHILE THE NUMBER OF INTERNET ACCOUNTS HAD GROWN ALMOST NINE   FOLD, FROM 40,000 IN LATE 1996 TO SOME 348,000 IN MID-1999. THE POOR   MARKET PROSPECT THAT REIGNED IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE INTERNET HAD   CERTAINLY BEEN REVERSED. ARGENTINA BECAME, BY LATE 1999, THE COUNTRY   WITH THE HIGHEST INTERNET HOST DENSITY AMONG THE LARGE ECONOMIES OF   LATIN AMERICA.   A NUMBER OF OBVIOUS QUESTIONS COME TO MIND WHEN CONFRONTED WITH THIS   PUZZLE: HOW CAN IT BE THAT IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME THE COUNTRY   REVERSED THE SITUATION IN WHICH IT WAS IN 1993? WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN   1993 AND 1999 THAT THE NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS TO THE INTERNET GREW MORE   THAN 255 PERCENT A YEAR, SHOOTING THE HOSTS DENSITY FROM 0.05 TO 39   INTERNET HOSTS PER 10,000 PEOPLE? THIS CASE STUDY ATTEMPTS TO PROVIDE   SOME CLUES TO THE INTERNET GROWTH PUZZLE IN ARGENTINA. MOST ANALYSTS   WOULD AGREE THAT CHANGES IN MARKET STRUCTURE AND PROFILE ARE NOT THE   PRODUCT OF A SINGLE FACTOR. THIS PAPER ARGUES, HOWEVER, THAT THE   INTERNET BOOM IN ARGENTINA LIES MAINLY ON TWO MAIN POLICY DECISIONS: (A)   THE REDUCTION IN THE PRICE OF LEASED LINES AND (B) THE REDUCTION OF   TARIFFS FOR LOCAL CALLS THROUGH THE CREATION OF A SPECIAL DIALLING   SCHEME FOR INTERNET-RELATED CALLS. THE PAPER PAYS SPECIAL ATTENTION TO   THESE REGULATORY CHANGES, THEIR IMPACT ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE INTERNET   IN ARGENTINA, AND THE SUBSEQUENT BENEFITS THAT THE NET HAS BROUGHT TO   BOTH BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS.

IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED   THAT INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN SUCH MENTAL MODELS, ASSESSED BY USING   THAGARD'S (1989) ECHO COMPUTER SIMULATION PROGRAM, WOULD PREDICT   PARTICIPANTS' ATTRIBUTIONS AND CONFIDENCE IN MAKING ATTRIBUTIONS. AFTER   WATCHING VIDEOTAPES OF TARGETS, 120 PARTICIPANTS RATED TARGETS' VERACITY   AND THEIR OWN CONFIDENCE IN MAKING ATTRIBUTIONS. HALF OF THESE   PARTICIPANTS ALSO PROVIDED `'ON-LINE'' INFORMATION THAT, IN TURN, WAS   ENTERED INTO ECHO. THE TWO GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER IN THEIR JUDGMENTS OF   VERACITY, BUT THE ON-LINE GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CONFIDENT.   RESULTS FROM ECHO AND NETWORK ANALYSIS INDICATED NOT ONLY THAT   PARTICIPANTS' MENTAL MODELS FOR DETECTING DECEPTION ARE DETAILED,   CHANGING, AND IDIOSYNCRATIC, VARYING IN THEIR STRUCTURE AND DEGREE OF   COHERENCE, BUT ALSO THAT A NUMBER OF PREVIOUSLY UNIDENTIFIED COGNITIVE   STRUCTURES ARE USED FOR DETECTING DECEPTION.

SPECIFICALLY, THREE FORMAT STRUCTURAL   VARIABLES (DECENTRALIZATION, FORMALIZATION, AND SLACK RESORCES), TWO   INFORMAL STRUCTURAL VARIABLES (RANGE AND PROMINENCE), AND TWO   COMMUNICATION ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (COMMUNICATION QUALITY AND   ACCEPTANCE) ARE POSITED TO BE ANTECEDENTS OF ORGANIZATIONAL   INNOVATIVENESS. IN THE TRADITIONAL MODEL, FORMAL STRUCTURAL IMPACTS ARE   POSITED TO BE SHAPED BY INFORMAL STRUCTURE. CONVERSELY, THE COEXISTING   MODEL ARGUES THAT BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL STRUCTURAL VARIABLES DIRECTLY   AFFECT THE COMMUNICATION ENVIRONMENT, WHICH, IN TURN, SHAPES PERCEPTIONS   OF INNOVATIVENESS. DATA WERE GATHERED FROM SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES   AND NETWORK ANALYSIS COMMUNICATION LOGS COMPLETED BY ORGANIZATIONAL   MEMBERS (N = 79) OF A GEOGRAPHICALLY DISPERSED GOVERNMENT HEALTH   INFORMATION AGENCY, THE CANCER INFORMATION SERVICE (CIS). TESTS OF THE   MODELS DEMONSTRATE THAT THE COEXISTING MODEL IS CLEARLY SUPERIOR.
